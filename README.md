# Crime-Rate-Predication
We have a dataset that pertains to robbery rates in three Canadian provinces, from 2011 to 2021. 
This study can help you understand how crime rates change during different times in Alberta, Manitoba and Ontario.
We create graphs and charts in Power BI to uncover important insights and make further predictions about future events.
